# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It fetches real-time weather data from an API to display the current weather conditions for a specified city. The project helped me deepen my understanding of React, Tailwind, and handling APIs effectively.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Fetches and displays current weather conditions.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for weather information by city name.
- **Dynamic Icons:** Displays weather icons corresponding to current conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.
- **OpenWeather API**: For fetching real-time weather data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- An API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```env
   VITE_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the app.
